    The kebab is a delicious dish originating from Middle Eastern cuisine that has gained popularity worldwide.
    This exquisite recipe starts with the selection of thin slices of meat, such as lamb, chicken, or beef, marinated
    in a mixture of aromatic spices including cumin, paprika, coriander, garlic, and black pepper. After an appropriate
    resting time, the meat is threaded onto long skewers and cooked on the grill or skewer. As the meat browns, its
    irresistible aroma fills the air.

    <li>In a container, mix the meat slices with cumin, paprika, coriander, chopped garlic, ground black pepper, and a
      pinch of salt. Ensure the meat is well coated with the spices and let it marinate for at least 30 minutes to
      enhance its flavor.</li>

      lemon juice, salt, and olive oil until you get a smooth paste. For the yogurt sauce, mix natural yogurt with salt
      and a dash of lemon juice.</li>
    <li>Preheat the grill or barbecue to medium-high heat. Thread the marinated meat slices onto the skewer sticks or
      long skewers.</li>
    <li>Cook the kebabs on the grill for approximately 5-7 minutes on each side, or until the meat is golden and well
      cooked.</li>
    <li>While the kebabs cook, lightly heat the pita bread or Arabic bread.</li>
    <li>To serve, place the cooked meat slices inside the pita bread or on a plate, accompanied by fresh lettuce,
      tomatoes, onion, and cucumber. Add the hummus, tahini, and yogurt sauces according to taste.</li>
